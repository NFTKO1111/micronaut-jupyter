A Micronaut configuration that integrates your app with an existing Jupyter
installation.

## Features

### Micronaut kernel

A special Micronaut kernel is provided to Jupyter that can be used to run
notebooks. This kernel can:

- Execute Groovy code
- Import classes on your Micronaut app's classpath
- Access Micronaut beans
- Use Micronaut Data repositories
- Use GORM Data Services and dynamic finders
- Access functionality available to the
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/twosigma/beakerx/blob/master/StartHere.ipynb[BeakerX Groovy]
kernel
  ** **Note:** This requires that the `beakerx` Python package (and possibly
    other Jupyter packages) be installed on the system separately.
